# JojoDnD5e-Foundry-Module
This module was designed using the Jojo DnD 5e supplement, I am not the creature of the supplement nor do I claim to be.

This module add all of the content for the supplement to foundry with some exeption(the weapons mostly and some automation). this is meant to remove most of the hard parts from running it on foundry i.e making the classes and features/feats your self and adding some automation.

This is meant for Foundry 12 version 343 and DnD5e version 4.4.3 it also has two dependentcies on is a hard requirment and the other is just for its character sheet

to install you must download the files once you have done that open foundry and right click the task bar icon and select user data, once there head to modules and place the files in there. Once you have that you will need to download 2 modules Dynamic active Effects (DAE) this is the hard requirement and Custom DnD 5E intsall both of these and enable them, as well as any reqirements that they need, after that open a character sheet and the cog icon in the top right and set the default sheet for all of the sheets to be the "Custome D&D 5e Character Sheet" otherwise your sheet will look messy and either be to big or cluttered. currently up-to-date with the latest version of the supplement as of 11/7/2025
